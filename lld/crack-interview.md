Perfect, now your requirement is **100% clear** 👍
You want a **LOW LEVEL DESIGN (LLD) MASTER PLAN**, **phase-by-phase**, inspired by a **good Udemy LLD course**, but **restructured for INTERVIEW CRACKING**, not random learning.

You already know *some* LLD, you’ve practiced *some* things — now you want a **complete, no-gaps roadmap** that:

* Covers **everything a good LLD course covers**
* Is **interview-oriented**
* Teaches **how interviewers expect answers**
* Helps you **design on whiteboard / paper**
* Makes you **confident at SDE-2 / Senior interviews**

Below is exactly that.
