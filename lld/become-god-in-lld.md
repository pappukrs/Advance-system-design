## Low Level Design (LLD) Mastery Plan - Phase by Phase

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**
**Goal:** Build strong OOP fundamentals and understand LLD basics

**Topics to Cover:**
1. **OOP Fundamentals Deep Dive**
   - Classes, Objects, Encapsulation
   - Inheritance (Is-a relationship)
   - Composition (Has-a relationship)
   - Polymorphism and Abstraction
   - Practice: 5-7 basic OOP problems

2. **SOLID Principles** (Critical!)
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Open/Closed Principle
   - Liskov Substitution Principle
   - Interface Segregation Principle
   - Dependency Inversion Principle
   - Practice: Refactor 2-3 code examples violating SOLID

3. **UML Basics**
   - Class diagrams
   - Relationship notations
   - Sequence diagrams basics

**Deliverables:**
- Create your own notes with examples for each SOLID principle
- Draw UML diagrams for 3 simple systems (Library, School, E-commerce)

### **Phase 2: Behavioral Design Patterns (Week 3-4)**
**Goal:** Master patterns that deal with object collaboration and responsibilities

**Patterns to Learn:**
1. **Strategy Pattern** - Algorithm encapsulation
2. **Observer Pattern** - Event-driven communication
3. **State Pattern** - Behavior based on state changes
4. **Chain of Responsibility** - Request handling chain
5. **Null Object Pattern** - Avoiding null checks
6. **Command Pattern** - Encapsulate requests (Undo/Redo)
7. **Iterator Pattern** - Sequential access
8. **Mediator Pattern** - Centralized communication
9. **Memento Pattern** - State capture/restore
10. **Template Method** - Algorithm skeleton
11. **Visitor Pattern** - Operations on object structures
12. **Interpreter Pattern** - Grammar interpretation

**Practice Approach:**
- Code each pattern from scratch (don't copy-paste)
- For each pattern: When to use? Real-world example? Trade-offs?
- Mini-project: Implement 2-3 patterns in a small application

---

### **Phase 3: Creational Design Patterns (Week 5)**
**Goal:** Master object creation mechanisms

**Patterns to Learn:**
1. **Factory Pattern** - Object creation without exposing logic
2. **Abstract Factory Pattern** - Families of related objects
3. **Singleton Pattern** - Single instance guarantee
4. **Builder Pattern** - Step-by-step object construction
5. **Prototype Pattern** - Cloning objects
6. **Object Pool Pattern** - Reusable object management

**Practice:**
- Implement each pattern with real examples
- Understand thread-safety in Singleton
- Practice Builder for complex object creation scenarios

---

### **Phase 4: Structural Design Patterns (Week 6)**
**Goal:** Master object composition and relationships

**Patterns to Learn:**
1. **Decorator Pattern** - Add behavior dynamically
2. **Proxy Pattern** - Control access with intermediary
3. **Composite Pattern** - Tree structures
4. **Adapter Pattern** - Interface compatibility
5. **Bridge Pattern** - Abstraction-implementation separation
6. **Facade Pattern** - Simplified interface
7. **Flyweight Pattern** - Memory optimization

**Practice:**
- Focus on when to choose which structural pattern
- Real-world scenarios for each pattern

---

### **Phase 5: LLD Interview Questions - Simple (Week 7-8)**
**Goal:** Practice basic to intermediate complexity problems

**Problems to Solve:**
1. **Design Tic-Tac-Toe Game** (Start here - simplest)
2. **Design Snake and Ladder Game**
3. **Design Parking Lot**
4. **Design ATM System**
5. **Apply Coupons on Shopping Cart**

**Approach for Each Problem:**
1. Understand requirements (15 mins)
2. Identify entities and relationships (20 mins)
3. Draw UML diagram (15 mins)
4. Identify applicable design patterns (10 mins)
5. Write clean code (60-90 mins)
6. Review and refactor (20 mins)

**Time Target:** 2-2.5 hours per problem initially

---

### **Phase 6: LLD Interview Questions - Medium (Week 9-10)**
**Goal:** Handle complex business logic and multiple patterns

**Problems to Solve:**
1. **Design Elevator System**
2. **Design Vending Machine** (State pattern heavy)
3. **Design Car Rental System**
4. **Design Movie Ticket Booking (BookMyShow)**
5. **Design Splitwise**
6. **Design Inventory Management System**

**Focus Areas:**
- Multi-threading considerations
- State management
- Complex workflows
- Multiple pattern integration

**Time Target:** 2.5-3 hours per problem

---

### **Phase 7: LLD Interview Questions - Advanced (Week 11-12)**
**Goal:** Master complex real-world applications

**Problems to Solve:**
1. **Design Cricbuzz App**
2. **Design Payment Gateway**
3. **Design Online Auction System** (Mediator pattern)
4. **Design Notification Service**
5. **Design Rate Limiter**

**Advanced Concepts:**
- Scalability considerations in LLD
- Database schema design hints
- API design basics
- MVC Architecture Pattern

---

### **Phase 8: Mock Interviews & Revision (Week 13-14)**
**Goal:** Interview readiness and speed improvement

**Activities:**
1. **Timed Practice:**
   - Solve random problems in 45 minutes (interview simulation)
   - Practice explaining your design verbally

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Given a problem, identify patterns in 2-3 minutes
   - Create a pattern selection cheat sheet

3. **Common Pitfalls:**
   - Over-engineering vs under-engineering
   - When NOT to use patterns
   - Code vs UML balance in interviews

4. **Mock Interviews:**
   - Practice with peers or use platforms
   - Record yourself explaining designs

---

## **Daily Study Schedule**

**Weekdays (2-3 hours):**
- 45 mins: Theory + Pattern study
- 60 mins: Coding practice
- 30 mins: Review & notes

**Weekends (4-5 hours):**
- 90 mins: Complete one LLD problem
- 90 mins: Code review & refactoring
- 60 mins: Mock practice/revision

---

## **Key Success Strategies**

1. **Code Everything:** Don't just watch videos - implement every pattern and problem
2. **UML First:** Always draw diagrams before coding
3. **Pattern Library:** Maintain a personal repository of all patterns with examples
4. **Explain Out Loud:** Practice explaining your designs verbally
5. **Time Yourself:** Gradually reduce time per problem
6. **Review Regularly:** Revisit earlier problems every 2 weeks

---

## **Interview Readiness Checklist**

By Week 14, you should be able to:
- ✅ Explain all SOLID principles with examples
- ✅ Identify and implement 20+ design patterns
- ✅ Design any system in 45-60 minutes
- ✅ Draw clear UML diagrams quickly
- ✅ Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- ✅ Write clean, production-quality code
- ✅ Handle follow-up questions confidently

---

## **Resources to Complement**
- Practice coding on GitHub (maintain a portfolio)
- LeetCode/InterviewBit for additional LLD problems
- "Head First Design Patterns" book for deeper understanding
- Join LLD communities for peer reviews

**Target Timeline:** 14 weeks of focused study
**Expected Outcome:** Ready to crack LLD interviews at top companies
